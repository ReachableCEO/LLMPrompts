# Texas series LLC Prompt Log

## Prompt 1

Generate me a markdown file for download with an operating agreement for a Texas series LLC called Turnkey Network Systems LLC.

The agreement needs to:

- specify a management company called Known Element Enterprises LLC
- be fully compliant with current Texas law
- Allow each series broad latitude to set its own operating agreement parameters but they can’t override anything that is set for the entire LLC
- The LLC as a whole needs to be managed by an independent board of directors elected by the members of the series LLC.
- The board will be governed by a charter that is separate from the operating agreement but referenced in the operating agreement. 

Made a few tweaks to arrive at (./output-v1.md. See the transcript here:

(Unfortunately I forgot to start a new chat and so it’s mixed with investment research I was doing yesterday).
